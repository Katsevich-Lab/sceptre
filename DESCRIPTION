Description: `sceptre` is a resource-light, fast, and statistically principled software for single-cell CRISPR screen analysis. `sceptre` is powered by methodological and algorithmic advances in robust association analysis via resampling score statistics and fast permutation testing. `sceptre` has modules for low multiplicity of infection (MOI) and high MOI single-cell CRISPR screen analysis.
