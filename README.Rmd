## Release of `sceptre` v0.9.1

We are excited to announce the release of `sceptre` v0.9.1, a substantial update to the package. This milestone includes the following developments:

-   A reimagined user experience based on a modular, object-oriented workflow.
-   Further improvements in speed and memory efficiency.
-   A unified interface for low- and high-MOI analyses.
-   A suite of plotting functions facilitating visualization of each step in the pipeline.
-   Expanded support for gRNA assignment and quality control.
-   Interoperability with output from 10X Cell Ranger and Parse Biosciences CRISPR Detect.
-   An [e-book](https://timothy-barry.github.io/sceptre-book/) guiding users through the entire process of analyzing their data using `sceptre`.

`sceptre` v0.9.1 facilitates an entire analysis pipeline for single-cell CRISPR screens, starting from UMI count data obtained from tools like 10X Cell Ranger.
