## v0.10.0: `sceptre` at massive scale

`sceptre` v0.10.0 represents another a major upgrade to the `sceptre` software. We have integrated `sceptre` with [`ondisc`](https://timothy-barry.github.io/ondisc/), a companion R package that facilitates large-scale computing on single-cell data. `sceptre` now supports the analysis of single-cell CRISPR screen data out-of-core on a laptop or distributed across hundreds of processors on a computing cluster or cloud.

`sceptre` v0.10.0 includes the following updates:

-   Support for disk-backed `sceptre` objects, enabling the analysis of data too large to fit in memory
-   A `sceptre` [Nextflow pipeline](https://github.com/timothy-barry/sceptre-pipeline), enabling the deployment of `sceptre` across hundreds of processors on a cluster or cloud
-   An updated [e-book](https://timothy-barry.github.io/sceptre-book/) containing new sections about at-scale `sceptre` and the statistical methodology underlying `sceptre`
-   New functionality for plotting and inspecting gRNA-to-cell assignments
-   A comprehensive suite of unit tests, helping to verify the correctness of the code
-   More detailed man pages (including a runnable example for each) and minor bug fixes
