The fifth step of the pipeline is to run the calibration check. The calibration check involves applying `sceptre` to analyze negative control target-response pairs --- pairs for which we know there is no association between the target and response --- to ensure control of the false discovery rate.

```{r, out.width = "650px", fig.align="center", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("pipeline_schematic_step_5.png")
```

We begin by loading `sceptre`.

```{r,results='hide'}
library(sceptre)
```

We initialize `sceptre_object`s corresponding to the low-MOI CRISPRko data and high-MOI CRISPRi data. We call the pipeline functions that precede `run_calibration_check()` (namely, `import_data()`, `set_analysis_parameters()`, `assign_grnas()`, and `run_qc()`) on both datasets.

```{r}
# low-MOI CRISPRko data
# 1. import data
sceptre_object_lowmoi <- import_data(response_matrix = lowmoi_example_data$response_matrix,
                                     grna_matrix = lowmoi_example_data$grna_matrix,
                                     extra_covariates = lowmoi_example_data$extra_covariates,
                                     grna_target_data_frame = lowmoi_example_data$grna_target_data_frame,
                                     moi = "low")
positive_control_pairs <- construct_positive_control_pairs(sceptre_object_lowmoi)
discovery_pairs <- construct_trans_pairs(sceptre_object = sceptre_object_lowmoi,
                                         positive_control_pairs = positive_control_pairs)

# 2-4. set analysis parameters, assign gRNAs, run qc
sceptre_object_lowmoi <- sceptre_object_lowmoi |>
  set_analysis_parameters(discovery_pairs = discovery_pairs,
                          positive_control_pairs = positive_control_pairs) |>
  assign_grnas() |> run_qc(p_mito_threshold = 0.075)
```

```{r, results='hide'}
# high-MOI CRISPRi data
# 1. import data
sceptre_object_highmoi <- import_data(response_matrix = highmoi_example_data$response_matrix,
                                      grna_matrix = highmoi_example_data$grna_matrix,
                                      grna_target_data_frame = grna_target_data_frame_highmoi,
                                      moi = "high",
                                      extra_covariates = highmoi_example_data$extra_covariates,
                                      response_names = highmoi_example_data$gene_names)
positive_control_pairs <- construct_positive_control_pairs(sceptre_object_highmoi)
discovery_pairs <- construct_cis_pairs(sceptre_object_highmoi,
                                       positive_control_pairs = positive_control_pairs,
                                       distance_threshold = 5e6)

# 2-4. set analysis parameters, assign gRNAs, run qc
sceptre_object_highmoi <- sceptre_object_highmoi |>
  set_analysis_parameters(discovery_pairs = discovery_pairs,
                          positive_control_pairs = positive_control_pairs,
                          side = "left") |>
  assign_grnas(parallel = TRUE) |> run_qc(p_mito_threshold = 0.075)
```

We are now ready to run the calibration check.

## Calibration check methodology

We begin by describing the methodology underlying the calibration check.

### Differential expression paradigm

The goal of the calibration check is to test for association between subsets of negative control gRNAs and responses. Suppose for simplicity that we are conducting a singleton analysis, i.e. suppose that we seek to test for association between an individual negative control gRNA and a response. The "treatment group" is the set of cells containing the given non-targeting gRNA, and the "control group" is the set of cells against which the treatment group is compared to carry out the test of association. The control group can be either the complement set or the NT cells. Within the context of the calibration check analysis, the complement set consists of the cells that do not contain the given non-targeting gRNA; the NT cells, on the other hand, consist of the cells that contain any non-targeting gRNA *excluding* the given non-targeting gRNA that we are testing for association against the response (see schematic below). `sceptre` carries out the test of association by testing for differential expression of the response across the treatment and control groups, yielding a p-value.

```{r, out.width = "750px", fig.align="center", echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A schematic illustrating the differential expression paradigm of the calibration check analysis. The single-cell CRISPR screen experiment produces a pool of cells; in this example the cells contain targeting gRNAs and three different non-targeting gRNAs (labeled NT$_1$, NT$_2$, and NT$_3$). Suppose that we seek to test for association between a given non-targeting gRNA (e.g., NT$_2$) and a response. First, we divide the cells into treatment and control groups, where the treatment group consists of the cells that contain NT$_2$, and the control group can be either the complement set or the NT cells. Within the context of the calibration check analysis, the complement set consists of all cells that do not contain NT$_2$; the NT cells, on the other hand, consist of cells that contain a non-targeting gRNA excluding NT$_2$. (Thus, in this example, the NT cells consist of cells that contain NT$_1$ or NT$_3$.) `sceptre` tests for differential expression of the given response across the treatment and control groups, yielding a p-value for the test of association bewteen the given non-targeting gRNA and the response."}

### Constructing the negative control pairs

The calibration check involves forming a set of negative control target-response pairs and then testing these pairs for association to ensure control of the false discovery rate. `sceptre` automatically constructs the negative control pairs, and it does so in such a way that the negative control pairs are highly similar to the discovery pairs, the difference being that the negative control pairs are devoid of biological signal. `sceptre` builds the negative control pairs as follows. First, `sceptre` forms "negative control groups" by randomly grouping together distinct sets of negative control gRNAs. For example, in a screen containing nine negative control gRNAs (labeled NT~1~ *-* NT~9~), gRNAs NT~2~, NT~5~, and NT~7~ might be assigned randomly to one group, gRNAs NT~3~, NT~6~, and NT~9~ might be assigned randomly to another group, and so on. (See schematic below). The number of negative control gRNAs per group (by default) is set equal to the average number of gRNAs per discovery target. For example, in a screen in which each discovery target is targeted by three gRNAs, each negative control group is formed by randomly putting together three negative control gRNAs. The negative control gRNA groups can (and often do) overlap; for example, a given NT gRNA (e.g., NT~2~) could be a part of multiple negative control groups.

```{r, out.width = "550px", fig.align="center", echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A schematic illustrating how the negative control target response pairs are constructed. First, negative control gRNA groups are formed by randomly assembling negative control gRNAs into groups of size one or more. Next, the negative control gRNA groups are randomly paired to responses. "}
knitr::include_graphics("neg_control_pair_construction.png")
```

In a singleton analysis (i.e., an analysis in which we seek to test for association between individual gRNAs and responses), each negative control gRNA is placed into its own negative control group of size one. (Recall that we can prompt `sceptre` to run a singleton analysis by setting `grna_grouping_strategy` to `"singleton"` in `set_analysis_parameters()`). We often use the term "negative control target" interchangeably with "negative control gRNA group."

After forming the negative control targets, `sceptre` constructs the set of negative control pairs by randomly pairing the negative control targets to the responses. The number of negative control pairs that `sceptre` constructs is set equal to the number of pairs in the discovery set (after QC is applied to the discovery pairs). Moreover, the negative control pairs are subjected to the same pairwise QC as the discovery pairs. In this sense the negative control pairs are "matched" to the discovery pairs in three respects: (1) the number of gRNAs contained within each target is the same across the negative control and discovery pairs; (2) the negative control pairs are subjected to the same pairwise QC as the discovery pairs; (3) the number of negative control pairs is equal to the number of discovery pairs.
