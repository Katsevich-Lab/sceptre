1. I am trying to install `sceptre` but am getting an error. What should I do?

The first thing to do is to remove any previous installations of `sceptre` and then try again. First, determine the directory on your computer in which R packages are stored by executing `.libPaths()` in the R console.

```{r}
.libPaths()
```

Next, within your terminal, `cd` to this directory and then execute `rm -rf sceptre`.

```
# in terminal
cd /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.2/Resources/library # change me!
rm -rf sceptre
```

Now, try to install `sceptre` again.

2. My negative control p-values are miscalibrated. What should I do?
