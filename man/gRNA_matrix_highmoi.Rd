\section{Overview}{

This object is part of the example data. The data are taken from the paper "A genome-wide framework for mapping gene regulation via cellular genetic screens" by Gasperini et al., 2019. The authors used a CRISPRi-based assay to target 5,000+ putative enhancers in a population of K562 cells. The authors additionally targeted 200+ gene transcription start sites (TSSs) and designed a library of 50 non-targeting gRNAs to serve as negative controls. Genes, gRNAs, and cells are all down-sampled to reduce the size of the data.
